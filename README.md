# PROJECT TITLE: 37 Boroughs

## Created by: Alanna, Ariane, Chris, Constantino, Ian

## !! IF UPDATING FRONT END
    Change the files in either 'templates/' or 'static/'
    I have converted the main pages to use templating so it is easier to update things
    and Styles have been moved into the style.css rather than templates
